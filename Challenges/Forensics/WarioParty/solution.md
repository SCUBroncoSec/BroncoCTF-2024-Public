# Solution

You can see there is information hidden in one of the bitplanes. 

The hint is Red 2, from Mario's color, and the number of brothers (2). 

Extracting, you get a file with Wario and Waluigi. 

Waluigi is tall and long (looking like the number 1). Wario is rounder and wide, looking like the number 0.

A quick script to detect yellow and purple in their hats can get you the numbers in binary. Or you can brute force write them down then decode.
