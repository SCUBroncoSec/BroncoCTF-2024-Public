# Solution

Recognize that the "c"s are less common than a and b. In fact, they come every 8 characters! 

From then, it is an experimentation of a and b as binary (most people should get it on the first try with 0 and 1 being a and b), then convert it to text.

A is 0, B is 1, C is space. 

```01100010 01110010 01101111 01101110 01100011 01101111 01111011 01101001 01011111 01101101 00110001 01110011 01110011 01011111 01110000 01110010 00110011 01110011 01100011 01101000 01101111 00110000 01101100 01111101```
