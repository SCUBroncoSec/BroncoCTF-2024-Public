### Lost Valentine

## Target Difficulty: Hard (550 Points)

## Description
Valentine's day came and past, and I am still pretty upset. My girlfriend didn't show up for dinner at the restaurant she made a reservation at. After about 30 minutes, the waiter came and left me a note in her handwriting: "cupid-is-upset"

What could that mean!!
