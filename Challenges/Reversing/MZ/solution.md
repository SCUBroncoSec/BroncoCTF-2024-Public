# Solution

The name of the challenge is a hint toward the header, and if you look at the header and look into MZ, you can see this is a MS DOS EXE, not a windows EXE. 

The easy solution is to run the challenge binary in an MS-DOS environment, such as DOSBox. You can also further reverse engineer it as well, though that was not the intended route.
